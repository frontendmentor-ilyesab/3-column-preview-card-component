## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project CSS Grid seemed to be the right tool to use for the layout of the overall container.
to go from one column to three columns from mobile to desktop.

Grid also seemed like a great tool to layout the different elements on each of the columns creating the
appropriate spacing rather than using only margin. 

I also learned that using grids inside a parent grid keeps the elements aligned vertically when we go to the three columns layout on desktop.

### Continued development

I'd like to practice more the combination of CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.
